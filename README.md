# Image Classification with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## 1. Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of an Image Classification model utilizing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the efficacy of neural networks in processing and categorizing high-dimensional image data.

The project is developed within a Jupyter Notebook environment, offering a step-by-step analysis of data preprocessing, model architecture design, training procedures, and performance evaluation.

## 2. Technical Architecture
The classification model is built using the **TensorFlow** and **Keras** frameworks. The architecture follows a traditional multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) structure:

**Input Layer:** Flattens the 2D image arrays into 1D vectors to be processed by the dense layers.

**Hidden Layers:** Composed of fully connected (dense) layers utilizing non-linear activation functions (e.g, ReLU) to capture complex patterns within the data.

**Output Layer:** A final dense layer utilizing the Softmax activation function to output probability distributions across the target classes.

## 3. Technologies & Dependencies
The project requires the following technologies and libraries:

* **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
